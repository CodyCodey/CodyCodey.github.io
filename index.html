            People are going to <span class="bold">starve</span> this coming
            winter. There is mass famine on the cards for countries. African and
            Middle Eastern countries will bear the brunt of this famine.

          <h2 class="question">Why Famine?</h2>
          <p class="answer">
            Simple Answer: <span class="bold">War</span>. In Ukraine. Ukraine
            was the top exporter of wheat grains before the war. Since the war
            has commenced, 20 million tonnes of wheat remain stuck inside
            country. Negotiations to move this wheat safely are going nowhere.
            Export bans by countries are not helping.

          <p class="answer">
            The pandemic killed <span class="bold">7-8 million</span> people.
            Majority of them old. This global famine will kill even more.
            Majority of them children. Most of them are still going to die. But
            perhaps your contributions will save a few.

          <h2 class="question">How to help?</h2>
          <p class="answer">
            Nothing major. Just <span class="bold">donate</span> a small amount
            to these charities. I have researched and made sure they are not
            money laundering fronts. As much as I hate to say it, you must also
            do your own research before donating to these charities lest I
            missed a detail.
